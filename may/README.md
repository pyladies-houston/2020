# May 2020 | Development using base Python libraries

Let this README serve as a guide for the May 2020 PyLadies Houston Meetup. Jennifer will walk us through using Python's Idle to write some of the most commonly used functions from scratch.

This will be an exercise in programming using Python's standard libraries and the associated documentation, to navigate the process of writing code without external resources like StackOverflow.


## Meetup objective

By the end of this session, attendees should 
- feel comfortable using Python's Idle to write code.
- understand how to navigate Python documentation and use it to guide their development.
- have the startings of developing an intuition for what happens under the hood of some frequently used methods.


## Setup

If you plan to follow along (which you should!), you should have Python 3 installed on your computer, and should be able to enter the python command-line interpreter via the terminal.
